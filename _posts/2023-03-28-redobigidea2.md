What I got wrong ofr Problem 2 was that I mixed up lossless nad lossy, which is a big mistake. If I knew the difference then that would make the decision to get the question correctly.


### Problem 6

For Problem # 6, I got the answers of A and C, but the correct answers was A and D. Which means that I got 50% correct on that problem. To improve in the future I will make sure to read the question more carefully and do not make the same mistake that I did before.

### Problem  21
