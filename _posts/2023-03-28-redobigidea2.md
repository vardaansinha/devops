### Problem 2

What I got wrong ofr Problem 2 was that I mixed up lossless nad lossy, which is a big mistake. If I knew the difference then that would make the decision to get the question correctly.


### Problem 6

For Problem # 6, I got the answers of A and C, but the correct answers was A and D. Which means that I got 50% correct on that problem. To improve in the future I will make sure to read the question more carefully and do not make the same mistake that I did before.

### Problem  21

For Problem # 21 What I did wrong was that I selected only one of the correct answers and did not focus on the others. What I learned from this is that it is important to focus on all of the options and read the directions carefully.





Apology: When we were doing the peer review we were in a rush to do them and we thought that they weren't as important as the grade that we were going to get from you. We re-did the quiz and made sure to do extra on the hacks that we completed. We promise to always do peer reviews properly in the future and if we do it again then you can take all seed points off. Our Grade fell two letters and made it almost impossible for us to come back.
