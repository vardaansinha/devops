What I did wrong was that I chose answer D, "An online retailer analyzing customers’ viewing habits to suggest other products based on the purchasing history of other customers", but the answer was actually C, "A high school analyzing student grades to identify the students with the top ten highest grade point averages".

I chose answer B, "The student is modifying the search procedure to take a definition as an argument and return the corresponding word.", but the answer was C, "The student is reusing the computer scientist’s procedural abstraction by knowing what the procedure does without knowing how it does it."

I chose answer C, but the correct answer was A. What I did wrong was that I did not read the code correctly which led to me getting the answer done.
