# My Project
My Night at the Musuem Project was mainly a Sports Page showing differnet statisitcs for the various sports: NFL, NBA, and Premier League. There are also brackets which can be made which show the different games and possibiliites. The main purpose of the project was for when people view our project they can understand more aobut out the whole world of sports. We gathered data on players prefromances and made sure that they would grasp all the necessary information on where people can view and make proper judgements on those players. The Brackets also provide a sense of real league where the viewers can see how the real league works with the various differnet teams in the league.
