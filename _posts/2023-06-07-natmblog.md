# My Project
My Night at the Musuem Project was mainly a Sports Page showing differnet statisitcs for the various sports: NFL, NBA, and Premier League. There are also brackets which can be made which show the different games and possibiliites. The main purpose of the project was for when people view our project they can understand more aobut out the whole world of sports. We gathered data on players prefromances and made sure that they would grasp all the necessary information on where people can view and make proper judgements on those players. The Brackets also provide a sense of real league where the viewers can see how the real league works with the various differnet teams in the league. We implemented many idffernet sorting methods as well as animation for the basketball screensaver.

# Night at the Museum Reflection
For My Night at the Musuem Reflection I belive that our project atracted a lot of differnet viewers, especilaly seniors and that made us feel good about creating our project. We also enjoyed watching different CSP Projects as well and looked at what our differnet friends made for their own projects. It was a really fun experience, and it provided a lot of insight on other differnet projects and what people decided to do for them. I also enjoyed walking aorund the entire place, looking at the differnet phtoographs, 3D Animation, and the various different activiites that were there to look at.
