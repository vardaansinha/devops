# My Project
My Night at the Musuem Project was mainly a Sports Page showing differnet statisitcs for the various sports: NFL, NBA, and Premier League. There are also brackets which can be made which show the different games and possibiliites. The main purpose of the project was for when people view our project they can understand more aobut out the whole world of sports. We gathered data on players prefromances and made sure that they would grasp all the necessary information on where people can view and make proper judgements on those players. The Brackets also provide a sense of real league where the viewers can see how the real league works with the various differnet teams in the league. We implemented many idffernet sorting methods as well as animation for the basketball screensaver. The different sorting methods were based of the differnet variables that were chosen. For the premier league stats which I worked on, we created sorting methods based on name, goals, height, weight, and team. All of these variables contirbuted to the overall creation of the premier league statistics for the viewrs to accuratley judge the players that are being seen through their data. One thing I really like in this project as well would be the Sports Trivia Game, because it had a lot of viewer interaction, so if the viewer wanted to test their sports knoweldge on the game then they would be able to show that knoweldge on the game. This makes our project not only informational but alos recreationals as well as allows users to have some entertainment within our project.

# Other CSP Projects
The concept behind this project resembles GeoGuesser, but with a unique twist. Instead of showcasing random locations worldwide, it focuses specifically on displaying images of various spots within the DNHS campus. This adds a localized touch and allows users to explore familiar surroundings in an entertaining way. In addition to the engaging frontend experience, the team's expertise shines through their implementation of backend functionalities. They demonstrate proficiency in handling intricate data structures and algorithms, as evident in their seamless data storage and retrieval mechanisms. This ensures that the game runs efficiently and allows for smooth gameplay without any hiccups or delays. The architecture they have chosen for the project is not only efficient but also scalable, showcasing their knowledge and skills in backend development. This ensures that as the user base expands, the system can handle the load and continue to deliver a seamless experience to all players. Overall, this project combines the excitement of GeoGuesser with a localized twist, showcasing the team's creativity and attention to detail. Their mastery of backend functionalities and the scalable architecture they have implemented speak to their expertise in developing robust and efficient systems.

Another project that I got to witness was thatof similar to of our project was Khaled project. Khaled worked on the NFL which was one of our topics. They also had statistics with their own data and variables. It was very refreshing to see how other groups also used sports as their topic for their project.


# Night at the Museum Reflection
For My Night at the Musuem Reflection I belive that our project atracted a lot of differnet viewers, especilaly seniors and that made us feel good about creating our project. We also enjoyed watching different CSP Projects as well and looked at what our differnet friends made for their own projects. It was a really fun experience, and it provided a lot of insight on other differnet projects and what people decided to do for them. I also enjoyed walking aorund the entire place, looking at the differnet phtoographs, 3D Animation, and the various different activiites that were there to look at.
