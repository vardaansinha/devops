### Skills that I have obtained
Skills that I have obtained over the year was definetly at first learning the simple ways to set up a computer and using WSL. Installing all the necessary requriements to first start working on APCSP gave me a larger toolset to use in the future as well as working with Jupyter Notebooks. ANother useful sill that I have obtained whilst in APCSP was the use of python programming. When I first came into APCSP I had little to no expericnce of python programming, but as I progressed through the years I learned the basics and with practice was able to progress further into larger pieces of code.

### Highs and Lows from year
The Highs from the year include going to the Night at the Museum or learning how to code more python. Lows from the year include not being able to complete hard hacks where the code was very either time consuming or hard to do.

### Future Plans with CompSci
Future plans with Compsci include me going towards APCSA, as well as looking into it as a future job. I might also try to do some projects outside of school to further my programming knowledge in python and manybe in other different programming lagnagues.

### Future plans in Education/Career
Future Plans in Education/Career include going into Colledge and looking for a bachelors degree and maybe start working a job right away or maybe get into masters. The Degree I take might be in Computer Science or in different STEM Fields.

### Other (Other Programming Languages)
After learning a lot of python other programming languages that I would really like to learn is Java, C++ because I feel like these programming languages would further my skills in Computer Science. I already have a decent amount of experience in python, javascript, and HTML.
