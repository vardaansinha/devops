### Our Stories

Woman 1:
Got a D in her first trimester for Physics. Both of Them just graduated Cal State San Marcos. Didn't have much guidance in STEM and failed multiple courses in STEM such as Cauclus. Got into reasearch for a lab that she was working on and which made her start her PHD. She feels like Cal State San Marcos allowed her to 

Man 1 (John): Bit of a delinquet in high school. Started in Palomar Colledge, got two associated one of them beign computer science. Pursued Computer Science degree and didn't spend too much time on campus. Finished the bacholer's degree, and talked about the versatility with the degree.

Question 1: How do you transger from one university to another?
Answer: There are certain departments in Universities which will acommodate the process and there might be different prerequisites that one might have to do to transfer universities.


### STEM Activites
What I did For My STEM Activites:

Me and My group worked Hard onn creating our STEM Activity as well as having fun with my freinds

### Reflection
In Conclusion, I learned a lot about what Cal States have to offers as well as specifically Cal State San Marcos. I also learned a lot about how financing works for colledge. I got a lot of tips about how to not use loans or if you do you use loans it is importnat to use subsidizied loans because it will lower the effect in the future. They also gave us tips on how to get scholarships by different ways. I also learned about the various different programs and clubs that are offered at the Cal State San Marcos and the various majors that I can take. The man in the presentation, John, also talked about how he got scholarships because he was mexican or mexican-american. This can also help me as diversity is increasingly getting more importnat in todays societies to help create a diverse colledge. He was able to transfer from community colledge to Cal State of San Marcos and was able to pay off all his loans off before his senior year ended, which is ideal for most colledge students. We also talked aobut how to transfer from different universities. They talked about that there would be a specific departments in the various departments as well as differnet prequisisties that one would have to take to transfer universities. IF I went to the school I would look into the CyberSecurity Club because it is very intersting and I have had a past experience with CyberSecurity which might make me feel a little more at home. If I went to the school, I would most likely be taking the Software Engineering Course, Computer Engineering Course, or Computer Inofrmation Sciences. I might also try CyberSecurity because it is importnat for the world and it seems kinda fun and important especially in todays world where a lot if not most of the infromation is getting stored on the internet. Data Protection is the future of keeping information and ideologies safe.



### Extra Credit Research on CSUSM
History:
Since the 1960s, political and community officials have worked to establish a public institution in North County. According to a study written by Glenn S. Dumke, chancellor of the CSU system, a new university site was "ultimately needed" in the region.

San Diego State University established a North County satellite campus in Vista in 1978 thanks to $250,000 in state money secured by Carlsbad state senator William A. Craven (1921-1999). The school had 148 students enrolled when it debuted. In an office building on Los Vallecitos Boulevard in San Marcos, the satellite relocated to bigger accommodations in 1982. CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds insisted on an autonomous university when it looked that the new San Marcos location would be a satellite of San Diego State with the aim of fostering leadership chances for women and minorities. In the future, CSUSM would draw more STEM-oriented pupils than SDSU. Craven proposed Senate Bill 1060, which was approved in September 1985 and allocated $250,000 for a report on the viability of establishing an institution in North County. The CSU board of directors paid $10.6 million to acquire the 304-acre Prohoroff Poultry Farm in San Marcos, the eventual location of CSUSM, in 1988, when SDSU North County had 1,250 students enrolled. The hillside location is about 35 miles (56 km) due north of central San Diego and 8 miles (13 km) straight east of the Pacific Ocean. The CSU trustees also asked the state for $51.8 million for the initial portion of building.

Cal State San Marcos was established by Governor George Deukmejian's signing Senate Bill 365, which was also supported by Craven, into law in 1989. After being appointed as the university's first president in June 1989, Bill W. Stacy spent the following year hiring the first 12 staff members. These twelve "founding faculty" members were crucial to the university's early development and are now recognized on the CSUSM grounds in Founders Plaza. $3.9 million was provided to Stacy and the faculty to launch the institution.

On February 23, 1990, the new campus' foundation was officially opened, and work on the abandoned poultry farm got under way. The first cohort of 448 juniors and seniors enrolled at the new institution in the autumn of 1990. (Initially, only upperclassmen were admitted to CSUSM.) Classes continued to be conducted at the old SDSU satellite site on Los Vallecitos Boulevard while work on the new campus was ongoing. The biology department also utilized a commercial building on Stone Drive for lab space, which was in use until January 1993. Seven pupils received Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1991, marking the institution's first degree awards. In May 1992, CSUSM conducted its inaugural graduation ceremony.
