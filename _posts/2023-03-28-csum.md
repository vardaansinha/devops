Question 1: How do you transger from one university to another?
Answer: There are certain departments in Universities which will acommodate the process and there might be different prerequisites that one might have to do to transfer universities.


### STEM Activites
What I did For My STEM Activites:

Me and My group worked Hard onn creating our STEM Activity as well as having fun with my freinds

### Reflection
In Conclusion, I learned a lot about what Cal States have to offers as well as specifically Cal State San Marcos. I also learned a lot about how financing works for colledge. I got a lot of tips about how to not use loans or if you do you use loans it is importnat to use subsidizied loans because it will lower the effect in the future. They also gave us tips on how to get scholarships by different ways. I also learned about the various different programs and clubs that are offered at the Cal State San Marcos and the various majors that I can take. The man in the presentation, John, also talked about how he got scholarships because he was mexican or mexican-american. This can also help me as diversity is increasingly getting more importnat in todays societies to help create a diverse colledge. He was able to transfer from community colledge to Cal State of San Marcos and was able to pay off all his loans off before his senior year ended, which is ideal for most colledge students. We also talked aobut how to transfer from different universities. They talked about that there would be a specific departments in the various departments as well as differnet prequisisties that one would have to take to transfer universities. IF I went to the school I would look into the CyberSecurity Club because it is very intersting and I have had a past experience with CyberSecurity which might make me feel a little more at home. If I went to the school, I would most likely be taking the Software Engineering Course, Computer Engineering Course, or Computer Inofrmation Sciences. I might also try CyberSecurity because it is importnat for the world and it seems kinda fun and important especially in todays world where a lot if not most of the infromation is getting stored on the internet. Data Protection is the future of keeping information and ideologies safe.
