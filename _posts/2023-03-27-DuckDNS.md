## How does Duck DNS Work?

Duck DNS is a free dynamic DNS service that allows users to assign a domain name to a dynamic IP address. 

Overall, Duck DNS provides a convenient way to access your home network or devices from anywhere in the world, even if your ISP assigns you a dynamic IP address

## How is Duck DNS useful for our project? Other Projects in General?

In general, Duck DNS can be useful for projects that involve remote access or control of a device, such as setting up a home security camera, remote desktop access, or hosting a website or game server from a home network. By using Duck DNS, the device or service can be accessed using a static hostname, which is more convenient than having to remember or constantly look up the device's changing IP address.

In addition, Duck DNS is easy to set up and does not require any special hardware or software. It can be configured to update the IP address automatically, making it a reliable and low-maintenance solution for dynamic IP addresses.

Overall, Duck DNS is a useful tool for any project that requires a static hostname for remote access or control of a device or service.

## Steps for Setup

- Sign up for a DuckDNS account by visiting [DuckDNS Link](https://www.duckdns.org/) and selecting "Create Account." If you already have an account, then click "Sign in with Github."
