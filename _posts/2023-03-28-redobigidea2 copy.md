# What are the different types of AWS Databases?

In order to meet the particular requirements of various use cases, AWS provides a variety of database services, each with its own special features and advantages.

Relational databases are among the most widely used AWS database types. Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Redshift are just a few of the relational databases that AWS offers. These databases are excellent for structured data and can be applied to financial applications, e-commerce platforms, and content management systems.

Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are also provided by AWS. These databases can easily handle high data volumes and were made for unstructured data. Amazon DocumentDB and Amazon DynamoDB are two well-known NoSQL databases that AWS offers.

The graph database is another kind of database that AWS provides. Graph databases are made to store and manage highly connected data, like that found in social networks or recommendation systems. One example of a graph database provided by AWS is Amazon Neptune.

AWS provides in-memory databases, which can provide low-latency performance for applications that need quick data access. An example of an in-memory database that can be used for applications like gaming or real-time analytics is Amazon ElastiCache.

In conclusion, users can select the AWS database that best suits their needs thanks to the variety of databases that are offered.
