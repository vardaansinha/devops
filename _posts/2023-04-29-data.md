1. How can Numpy and Pandas be used to preprocess data for predictive analysis?
i. What machine learning algorithms can be used for predictive analysis, and how do they differ?
Linear Regression: This algorithm is used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It is a simple algorithm that works well when there is a linear relationship between the variables. Logistic Regression: This algorithm is used for predicting a binary outcome (e.g., yes/no, true/false) based on one or more independent variables. It is a type of regression that works well when the outcome is categorical. 

ii. Can you discuss some real-world applications of predictive analysis in different industries?
Predictive analysis is widely used in finance for fraud detection, credit risk assessment, and investment portfolio management. For example, banks can use predictive models to identify creditworthy customers and reduce the risk of default. Also, predictive analysis can be used to optimize production processes, reduce downtime, and improve quality control. For example, manufacturers can use predictive maintenance to identify potential equipment failures before they occur and schedule maintenance to prevent downtime.

iii. Can you explain the role of feature engineering in predictive analysis, and how it can improve model accuracy?
