Question 1: How do you transger from one university to another? Answer: There are certain departments in Universities which will acommodate the process and there might be different prerequisites that one might have to do to transfer universities. . STEM Activites . What I did For My STEM Activites: . Me and My group worked Hard onn creating our STEM Activity as well as having fun with my freinds . Reflection . In Conclusion, I learned a lot about what Cal States have to offers as well as specifically Cal State San Marcos. I also learned a lot about how financing works for colledge. I got a lot of tips about how to not use loans or if you do you use loans it is importnat to use subsidizied loans because it will lower the effect in the future. They also gave us tips on how to get scholarships by different ways. I also learned about the various different programs and clubs that are offered at the Cal State San Marcos and the various majors that I can take. The man in the presentation, John, also talked about how he got scholarships because he was mexican or mexican-american. This can also help me as diversity is increasingly getting more importnat in todays societies to help create a diverse colledge. He was able to transfer from community colledge to Cal State of San Marcos and was able to pay off all his loans off before his senior year ended, which is ideal for most colledge students. We also talked aobut how to transfer from different universities. They talked about that there would be a specific departments in the various departments as well as differnet prequisisties that one would have to take to transfer universities. IF I went to the school I would look into the CyberSecurity Club because it is very intersting and I have had a past experience with CyberSecurity which might make me feel a little more at home. If I went to the school, I would most likely be taking the Software Engineering Course, Computer Engineering Course, or Computer Inofrmation Sciences. I might also try CyberSecurity because it is importnat for the world and it seems kinda fun and important especially in todays world where a lot if not most of the infromation is getting stored on the internet. Data Protection is the future of keeping information and ideologies safe. .",

            "title": "Duck DNS (Shaurya Goel)",
            "content": "How does Duck DNS Work? . Duck DNS is a free dynamic DNS service that allows users to assign a domain name to a dynamic IP address. Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a system used to map a domain name to an IP address that may change frequently, such as the IP address assigned by an ISP to a residential or small business internet connection. . Once the client program is set up, it will periodically send an update to the Duck DNS servers with your current IP address. When someone tries to access your domain name, the DNS server will resolve the domain name to your current IP address, allowing the requester to connect to your device. . Overall, Duck DNS provides a convenient way to access your home network or devices from anywhere in the world, even if your ISP assigns you a dynamic IP address . How is Duck DNS useful for our project? Other Projects in General? . In general, Duck DNS can be useful for projects that involve remote access or control of a device, such as setting up a home security camera, remote desktop access, or hosting a website or game server from a home network. By using Duck DNS, the device or service can be accessed using a static hostname, which is more convenient than having to remember or constantly look up the device’s changing IP address. . In addition, Duck DNS is easy to set up and does not require any special hardware or software. It can be configured to update the IP address automatically, making it a reliable and low-maintenance solution for dynamic IP addresses. . Overall, Duck DNS is a useful tool for any project that requires a static hostname for remote access or control of a device or service. . Steps for Setup . Sign up for a DuckDNS account by visiting https://www.duckdns.org/ and selecting “Create Account.” | Once you have created an account, you will be prompted to create a subdomain. Enter a unique name for your subdomain, and then click the “Add Domain” button. | Next, you will need to download the DuckDNS client to keep your IP address updated. You can find the client at https://www.duckdns.org/install.jsp. Choose the appropriate client for your operating system. | Once you have downloaded the client, extract the files and run the installation script. | After installation, you will be prompted to enter your DuckDNS subdomain and token. You can find your token by logging into your DuckDNS account and clicking the “Install” tab. | Start the DuckDNS client, and it will automatically update your IP address every time it changes. You can confirm that the client is working by checking the “Logs” tab in your DuckDNS account. | Finally, you can use your DuckDNS subdomain to access your home network from the internet. To do this, you will need to configure your router to forward incoming requests to your local IP address. | .",

The containers are streamed directly to the browser. The platform is similar to Citrix and VMware Horizon, but entirely container based.” . Essentially, KASM allows you to stream applications from docker containers. . Functionality Link: . KASM Functionalities . There are many different types of workspaces that KASM offers, such as: . Desktop Workspaces: Here, you can get desktop access in a moment of seconds from any device and from anywhere around the world. It is done in a secure manner through whichever web browser you like. | Functionality Demo: . Web Isolation Workspaces: There is a “zero-trust browser isolation” service. You can launch a private web browsing instance, where there is “no risk of compromising your endpoint.” | Functionality Demo: . Application Workspace (App Streaming): This is the main workspace which we are going to focus on. This workspace allows for an application container where the KASM platform does most of the heavylifting for us. It is customizable, open source, and kept up to date. You can choose either a server or cloud deployment option, and you can manage your own Self-Hosted Server in a separate version type created for this situation. | There are three different option plans for KASM: . Community Plan: Offers all enterprise features, and it is for personal use. You get community support, but there is a 5 concurrent session limit. . | Professional Plan: This is a $5 user/month plan.

            "title": "Advanced Security Certbot",
            "content": "Certbot is a software run in Python. It is meant to convert HTTP sites to work with HTTPS, which is much more secure. Let’s first explore the background of HTTP to HTTPS: HTTPS and HTTP are almost essentially the same protocols, but HTTPS uses SSL to encrypt the requests and responses. Furthermore, HTTPS is also used in the form of SSL certificates used to encrypt and digitally sign these requests. HTTP runs on port 80, and is an incredibly insecure platform to run a site on. HTTPS runs on ports 80 and 443, and needs a Certification Authority signature for the SSL certificate being used on the https site. APPLICATION IN CSP, PROS/CONS During Trimester 1, while initially setting up our AWS deployment, we attempted to implement Let’s Encrypt, a certificate authority manager, along with Certbot. The Certbot configuration is relatively easy: as shown in Trimester 1, you have to install a couple of packages, create the certbot folders on the AWS deployment server, and activate HTTPS for your domain. Though it is relatively easy to use, we decided to weigh out some of the pros/cons of using Let’s Encrypt &amp; Certbot: PROS: . Let’s Encrypt is a free service. | It is issued very efficiently. | It is something that most of our students are already familiar with, so it is a smoother process to setup. CONS: | Certificates have to be replaced/renewed every 90 days. This can be a painful process, especially for multiple sites and groups to do. | Some domains block Let’s Encrypt, and have relationships with other SSL providers. | It is a platform that is vulnerable to malware attacks. Almost 15 thousand Let’s Encrypt certificates have been issued to phishing sites. Is this another risk that we want to factor in? In our opinion, this is too much to consider and it could be beneficial to look at alternatives. |",
