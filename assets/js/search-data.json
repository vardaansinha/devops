Note: I do not meet the requirements to run KASM as a vm on my laptop, therefore this guide has not been tested. I will try maybe setting all this up on a seperate device if I can. Maybe everything could be installed on our AWS? . apparently AWS free tier only gives 30 GB. I guess I&#39;ll talk to cs teachers later? . installation . simply run the following in terminal to install . cd /tmp curl -O https://kasm-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/kasm_release_1.12.0.d4fd8a.tar.gz tar -xf kasm_release_1.12.0.d4fd8a.tar.gz sudo bash kasm_release/install.sh . afterwards, the console will print out some credentials that you MUST save somewhere for logging in later. . If your PC does not have a swap file, you will need to create one immediately after installing KASM . simply run the following commands in terminal: . sudo bash kasm_release/install.sh --accept-eula --swap-size 4096 . After all the installation, you can access your KASM VM by going to the ip address you set up KASM on. From there, you must log in as admin, which will allow you to manage enviorments and workspaces . If you want to run a program in the VM, click on workspaces and just run the program you want to run from the menu. . important . you should be able to run all of this in an ec2 instance on AWS and then be able to run docker images stored on your instance through KASM. However, storage on EC2 instances is limited. If you are able to run docker images on an ec2 instance with KASM, that would be really impressive. .",

            "title": "Guide to SQLite vs AWS alternate databases",
            "content": "What is AWS . AWS offers several alternate databases in addition to their popular managed relational database service (RDS). These alternate databases provide different functionality and are optimized for specific use cases. One such alternate database is Amazon DynamoDB, which is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service that allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data, with low latency and predictable performance.Another alternate database offered by AWS is Amazon Neptune, which is a fast, reliable, and fully-managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. . What is SQlite . SQLite is a widely used embedded database management system that is known for its simplicity, reliability, and ease of use. It is a serverless, self-contained, and transactional database engine that is designed to be embedded into applications rather than run as a standalone server. SQLite databases are stored as files on disk, making them easy to backup, copy, and transport between systems. They support standard SQL syntax and are fully ACID compliant, ensuring data consistency and reliability. . import sqlite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;example.db&#39;) c = conn.cursor() # create table c.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE stocks (date text, symbol text, price real)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # insert data c.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO stocks VALUES (&#39;2022-03-27&#39;, &#39;AAPL&#39;, 133.52)&quot;) # save changes conn.commit() # query data for row in c.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM stocks&#39;): print(row) conn.close() . AWS Vs SQlite . SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database management system (RDBMS) that is well-suited for small-scale projects or applications. AWS offers a wide range of database options, including relational, NoSQL, and in-memory databases, each with its own set of pros and cons. Here are some of the pros and cons of alternative AWS databases in comparison to SQLite: . Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS): Amazon RDS is a fully managed relational database service that supports multiple database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. Pros: . Scalability: RDS can easily scale to handle a large amount of traffic and data. High Availability: RDS offers automatic failover and backup options to ensure data availability. Security: RDS offers robust security features, such as encryption at rest and in transit. Managed Service: RDS is a managed service, meaning that AWS handles the administrative tasks of the database, such as backups, updates, and maintenance. Cons: . Cost: RDS can be more expensive than SQLite, especially for small-scale projects or applications. Complexity: RDS can be more complex to set up and manage than SQLite. Amazon DynamoDB: Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and is designed for scalability and high availability. . AWS Databases . Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a range of database services to meet various data storage and processing needs. Some of the popular AWS databases are: . Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS): It provides fully managed relational databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora. . Amazon DynamoDB: It is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides high performance, scalability, and automatic scaling of throughput capacity. .

            "content": "How does Duck DNS Work? . Duck DNS is a free dynamic DNS service that allows users to assign a domain name to a dynamic IP address. Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a system used to map a domain name to an IP address that may change frequently, such as the IP address assigned by an ISP to a residential or small business internet connection. . Once the client program is set up, it will periodically send an update to the Duck DNS servers with your current IP address. When someone tries to access your domain name, the DNS server will resolve the domain name to your current IP address, allowing the requester to connect to your device. . Overall, Duck DNS provides a convenient way to access your home network or devices from anywhere in the world, even if your ISP assigns you a dynamic IP address . How is Duck DNS useful for our project? Other Projects in General? . In general, Duck DNS can be useful for projects that involve remote access or control of a device, such as setting up a home security camera, remote desktop access, or hosting a website or game server from a home network. By using Duck DNS, the device or service can be accessed using a static hostname, which is more convenient than having to remember or constantly look up the device’s changing IP address. . In addition, Duck DNS is easy to set up and does not require any special hardware or software. It can be configured to update the IP address automatically, making it a reliable and low-maintenance solution for dynamic IP addresses. . Overall, Duck DNS is a useful tool for any project that requires a static hostname for remote access or control of a device or service. . Steps for Setup . Sign up for a DuckDNS account by visiting https://www.duckdns.org/ and selecting “Create Account.” | Once you have created an account, you will be prompted to create a subdomain. Enter a unique name for your subdomain, and then click the “Add Domain” button. | Next, you will need to download the DuckDNS client to keep your IP address updated. You can find the client at https://www.duckdns.org/install.jsp. Choose the appropriate client for your operating system. | Once you have downloaded the client, extract the files and run the installation script. | After installation, you will be prompted to enter your DuckDNS subdomain and token. You can find your token by logging into your DuckDNS account and clicking the “Install” tab. | Start the DuckDNS client, and it will automatically update your IP address every time it changes. You can confirm that the client is working by checking the “Logs” tab in your DuckDNS account. | Finally, you can use your DuckDNS subdomain to access your home network from the internet. To do this, you will need to configure your router to forward incoming requests to your local IP address. | .",

            "content": "Certbot is a software run in Python. It is meant to convert HTTP sites to work with HTTPS, which is much more secure. Let’s first explore the background of HTTP to HTTPS: HTTPS and HTTP are almost essentially the same protocols, but HTTPS uses SSL to encrypt the requests and responses. Furthermore, HTTPS is also used in the form of SSL certificates used to encrypt and digitally sign these requests. HTTP runs on port 80, and is an incredibly insecure platform to run a site on. HTTPS runs on ports 80 and 443, and needs a Certification Authority signature for the SSL certificate being used on the https site. APPLICATION IN CSP, PROS/CONS During Trimester 1, while initially setting up our AWS deployment, we attempted to implement Let’s Encrypt, a certificate authority manager, along with Certbot. The Certbot configuration is relatively easy: as shown in Trimester 1, you have to install a couple of packages, create the certbot folders on the AWS deployment server, and activate HTTPS for your domain. Though it is relatively easy to use, we decided to weigh out some of the pros/cons of using Let’s Encrypt &amp; Certbot: PROS: . Let’s Encrypt is a free service. | It is issued very efficiently. | It is something that most of our students are already familiar with, so it is a smoother process to setup. CONS: | Certificates have to be replaced/renewed every 90 days. This can be a painful process, especially for multiple sites and groups to do. | Some domains block Let’s Encrypt, and have relationships with other SSL providers. | It is a platform that is vulnerable to malware attacks. Almost 15 thousand Let’s Encrypt certificates have been issued to phishing sites. Is this another risk that we want to factor in? In our opinion, this is too much to consider and it could be beneficial to look at alternatives. |",
