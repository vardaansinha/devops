    "- Sass alows one to write clean, easy, and less CSS in a programing construct\n",

    "### What are some benefits to SASS?: \n",
    "- There is fewer codes so one can write CSS quicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Describe/Explain one of the more \"advanced\" SASS properties below in detail:\n",
    "- The more advanced SASS properties is the meta.variable-exists() function which provides a couple advanced functions for working with variables. The meta.variable-exists() function returns whether a variable with the given name exists in the current scope, and the meta.global-variable-exists() function does the same but only for the global scope.\n",

    "### How does the number guesser game work?\n",
    "- The user can guess a random number between 1 and 100 that is generated by the number guesser game. The game counts the amount of guesses and notifies the player if their guess is high or low after each one. The game concludes when the user correctly guesses the winning number, and it shows how many guesses it took to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain how SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing?\n",
    "- By setting variables for frequently used values like colors, font sizes, and spacing, SASS may be used to make the number guesser game look more aesthetically pleasing. This enables uniform styling across the entire game and makes it simple to update the styles in one location. Additionally, SASS nesting can be utilized to arrange styles and enhance readability. Additionally, reusable styles for items like buttons and form components can be defined using SASS mixins."
