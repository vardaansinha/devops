<blockquote>
  <p>As we have learned, a computer needs aa program to do something smart.  The sequence of a program initiates a series of actions with the computers Central Processing Unit (CPU). This component is essentially a binary machine focussing on program instructions provided.  The CPU retrieives and stores the data it acts upon in Random Access Memory (RAM). Between the CPU, RAM, and Storage Devices a computer can work with many programs and large amounts of data.</p>

      <li>A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.</li>
      <li>A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.</li>
      <li>A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.</li>
      <li>A computer network is a type of computing system.</li>
      <li>A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a receiver) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver.</li>
      <li>Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver.</li>
      <li>The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.</li>
      <li>Bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second</li>

<p><strong>TRUE: Open standards and protocols enable different manufacturers and developers to build hardware and software that can communicate with hardware and software on the rest of the internet.</strong></p>

<p><strong>FALSE: IETF is a task force used to enforce laws to keep manufacturers out of the internet.</strong></p>

<p><strong>FALSE: Routes are determined in advance and are not flexible.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRUE: A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.</strong></p>

<p><strong>FALSE: UDP guarantees transfers and is faster.</strong></p>

<p><strong>FALSE: The World Wide Web is the internet.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRUE: HTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Essential Knowledge
    <ul>
      <li>The internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonproprierary) communication protocols.</li>
      <li>Access to the internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an internet connected device.</li>
      <li>A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.</li>
      <li>The protocols used in the internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the internet.</li>
      <li>Routing on the internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance</li>
      <li>The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands.</li>
      <li>The internet was designed to be scalable</li>
      <li>Information is passed through the internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets.</li>
      <li>Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the internet, as well as for data reassembly.</li>
      <li>Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all</li>
      <li>IP, TCP and UDP are common protocols used on the internet.</li>
      <li>The world wide web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files.</li>
      <li>HTTP is a protocol used by the world wide web</li>
      <li>The world wide web uses the internet</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Go over AP videos, vocabulary, and essential knowledge.  Draw a diagram showing the internet and its many levels.

  <li>Often we draw pictures of machines communicating over the Internet with arrows.  However, the real communication goes through protocol layers and the machine and then is trasported of the network.

<p>The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for <strong><em>communication between web browsers and web servers</em></strong>. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts.  The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller <strong><em>chunks called “segments”</em></strong>. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection.</p>

<p>The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then <strong><em>encapsulating the data into IP packets</em></strong>. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network.</p>

<p>The “network” layer is responsible for <strong><em>routing data packets between networks</em></strong> using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and <strong><em>network congestion</em></strong> control.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Watch both Daily videos for 4.2</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Complete the network activity, summarize your understanding of fault tolerance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network operation was a very good practical method to analyze the networks of  certain  tens of lines and check their malfunction. Basically, fault tolerance means that in a network of many different sources and destinations, if one route goes down, there is still redundancy and the network can go from the  source to the destination. There is not only one path from A to B, so if that one path goes down,  A can take several paths to eventually reach B.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Review previous lecture on Parallel Computing and watch Daily vidoe 4.3.  Think of ways to make something in you team project to utilize Cores more effectively.  Here are some thoughts to add to your story of Computers and Networks…</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>What is naturally Distributed in Frontend/Backend archeticture?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In a frontend/backend architecture, the user interface is naturally distributed to the frontend layer while the data storage is handled by the backend layer. The frontend layer is responsible for presenting the user interface and handling user interactions, while the backend layer is responsible for storing and managing data. This division of responsibilities allows for more efficient development and easier maintenance of the overall system.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Analyze this command in Docker: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS="--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086"</code>.   Determine if there is options are options in this command for parallel computing within the server that runs python/gunicorn.  Here is an <a href="https://medium.com/building-the-system/gunicorn-3-means-of-concurrency-efbb547674b7">article</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The command ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=”–workers=1 –bind=0.0.0.0:8086” sets an environment variable named GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS with two options. The –workers=1 option specifies that only one worker process should be used, which means that parallel computing within the server is not being utilized. The –bind=0.0.0.0:8086 option specifies the IP address and port that Gunicorn should bind to.</strong></p>

  <p>Last week we discussed parallel computing on local machine.  There are many options.  Here is something to get parallel computing work with a tool called Ray.</p>
